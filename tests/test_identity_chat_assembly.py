"""Identity-aware turn assembly in the continuous loop.

Each message turn the loop pulls constitution + relevant self-model
entries + per-person relationship context, then builds *per-hemisphere*
system prompts (`turn.build_per_driver_system_prompts`) which reach the
drivers as the `system` message of each `GenerateRequest`.

These tests verify, by inspecting the recorded `GenerateRequest`s on the
fake drivers:

  - With identity configured, both drivers receive a system prompt
    carrying the constitution (name/pronouns/coreValues/freeText).
  - Both drivers receive the SAME persona body — v0.2.x dropped the
    per-hemisphere preamble; divergence comes from the models being
    different and from per-pass cross-talk, not from preamble framing.
  - An explicit non-NIL `personId` resolves that person's relationship
    context; the operator does NOT leak in.
  - A NIL `personId` + identity wired resolves the operator's personId.
  - Self-model entries are filtered to the related person.
  - An identity-service outage degrades gracefully: the loop still
    speaks, using the `defaultSystemPrompt` fallback (mentions Eugene).
  - The no-preamble invariant: left_sys == right_sys, no per-side
    labels, no architecture meta.
