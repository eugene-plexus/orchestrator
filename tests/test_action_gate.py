"""The action-selection gate: speak vs stay-silent over anticipated valence.

Four layers, matching the plateau gate's coverage shape:
  1. Exact value arithmetic (the linear value model) + the softmax math.
  2. Behavior: an addressed Eugene almost always speaks at neutral mood;
     a sufficiently aversive state makes silence emerge; positive mood
     locks in speaking; removing the address removes the drive.
  3. Seeded determinism (bit-exact under a fixed seed) + different seeds
     can diverge near a marginal choice.
  4. Clamp-and-sample: hold mood fixed, sweep seeds, confirm the silence
     RATE rises monotonically as mood falls — the statistical contract.
  5. Loop integration: a neutral turn speaks (gate=speak + a speech event);
     a silence-forcing config makes the gate choose idle — no voice pass,
     no speech, but the bout still thought + evolved NT + flushed its trace.
