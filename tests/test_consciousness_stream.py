"""Consciousness-stream events must survive the SSE route's serialization.

`GET /v1/stream/consciousness` does `json.dumps(data)` on every event the
loop publishes; a payload with a non-JSON-serializable field (e.g. an
NTState `lastUpdated` datetime that skipped `mode="json"`) would raise and
kill the subscriber's stream. The direct-loop tests read the event dict
straight off the broker queue and never exercise json.dumps, so this test
guards the serialization contract explicitly.
