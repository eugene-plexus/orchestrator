"""The plateau-stop gate: the noisy dopamine-RPE bout-end.

Three layers of coverage:
  1. BoutGate unit behavior with noise OFF (exact arithmetic): pass 0
     never stops, a flat (no-improvement) bout plateaus, sustained
     improvement extends it, and net valence shifts the stop.
  2. Seeded determinism with noise ON — the production path is stochastic
     but bit-exact under a fixed seed (the "seed the RNG, don't disable
     the noise" contract).
  3. Clamp-and-sample: hold the inputs fixed, sweep N seeds, and confirm
     the stop-pass DISTRIBUTION shifts in the predicted directions — the
     statistical validation of the non-deterministic component.
  4. Loop integration: a healthy bout ends on the plateau (Decision.
     terminate); a degenerate gate that never plateaus hits the cost fuse
     (Decision.cap_reached).
