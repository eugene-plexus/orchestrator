"""NT-system integration through the continuous loop's message turn.

Verify (translated from the v0.2 `POST /v1/chat` round-trips):
  - NT state evolves on the turn and is emitted on the consciousness
    stream as an `nt_update` event (the live evolution of v0.2's
    `ChatResponse.ntStateAtEnd`).
  - A settled (high-agreement) turn moves GABA + dopamine up. The impulse
    map keys "calm" on whether the bout SETTLED (final agreement ≥
    threshold), not on pass count — under the plateau-stop a clean
    convergence is no longer synonymous with "exactly one pass."
  - Low per-pass latency pulls norepinephrine down.
  - NT state evolves across turns on the same app — it is mutated in
    place, not reset per message (the live evolution of v0.2's
    `ntStateAtStart`/`ntStateAtEnd` continuity + the admin nt-state route,
    which just returns `app.state.nt_state`).

DROPPED: `test_high_cortisol_widens_modulated_max_passes` — NT no longer
modulates the pass count (deliberation depth is owned by the plateau-stop
gate; `modulated_max_passes` was deleted, since a count is the kind of
arbitrary cognitive limit the design forbids).
