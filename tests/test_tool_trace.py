"""The continuous loop emits a `tool_call` event per ToolRunner invocation.

Every orchestrator operation runs through the ToolRunner; in the
continuous runtime each invocation is published to the consciousness
stream as a `tool_call` event — the live evolution of the v0.2
`ChatResponse.toolInvocations` trace — so the UI can render the
perception/action layer beneath deliberation.
