"""Continuous-loop memory + personId wiring tests (M2 slice 2 rewrite).

These verify the memory contract the loop preserves from the v0.2 chat
handler, now driven through `drive_message` instead of `POST /v1/chat`:

  - The loop writes full MemoryEntries (personId, NT snapshot,
    hemisphereAttribution="voice" on the reply, reply content = the voice
    pass output) — not bare Messages.
  - When identity resolves an operator personId, both writes for the
    turn use that personId.
  - An explicit (body) personId wins over the operator fallback.
  - With neither identity nor an explicit personId, writes fall back to
    NIL_PERSON_ID without failing the turn.
  - `person_recent` enrichment is injected into the hemisphere prompts
    only for non-NIL personIds, excluding the active conversation.
  - For a NIL person, `person_recent` is skipped — no NIL-bucket leak.
