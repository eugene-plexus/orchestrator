"""Auth state for the orchestrator's verify-only role.

Built once at startup from the env vars the watchdog threads in
when it spawns the orchestrator:

  * `EUGENE_PLEXUS_ORCH_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY` — base64 of the 32-byte HMAC
    key used to validate inbound bearer tokens.
  * `EUGENE_PLEXUS_ORCH_SERVICE_TOKEN` — long-lived JWT (`aud:
    service:orchestrator`) presented as `Authorization: Bearer ...` on
    every outbound call to a peer component.
  * `EUGENE_PLEXUS_ORCH_MASTER_KEY` — base64 of the 32-byte secretbox
    key. Populated only after the operator has logged in at the
    watchdog; absent during the "configured-but-locked" window.
    Reserved for Phase 6 at-rest decryption — not consumed in Phase 3.

If `AUTH_SIGNING_KEY` is unset, the orchestrator runs in
`auth_disabled=True` mode: route dependencies short-circuit and let
everything through, and outbound clients send no Authorization header.
That's the dev/standalone-test path; production via the watchdog
always supplies the env var.
