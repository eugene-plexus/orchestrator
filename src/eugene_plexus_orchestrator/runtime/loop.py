"""The consciousness loop — Eugene's single, continuous cognitive task.

One Eugene = one consciousness = one workspace = one attention. This loop
is the *only* thing that thinks: HTTP handlers inject `AfferentEvent`s
onto its queue (`POST /v1/events`) and subscribe to its observability
stream (`GET /v1/stream/consciousness`). Because exactly one task mutates
cognitive state, there is no locking anywhere in the cognition path.

**Cognition flow** on a `message` event: recall → per-driver prompts →
bicameral deliberation (depth owned by the plateau-stop gate, not a fixed
pass count) → NT tick → the action gate elects *speak* or *stay-silent* on
anticipated net NT valence → (if speaking) voice pass → persist → emit an
`EfferentSpeechAct`. The whole thing is fire-and-forget — no caller waits
on a response; the reply leaves asynchronously as the speech act — and
every step publishes to the consciousness stream. Adenosine/sleep,
presence, self-initiated (unaddressed) speech, and multi-focus salience
switching layer on in later increments — see
`docs/design/m1-continuous-runtime.md` in `specs`.

Errors NEVER crash the loop: there is no caller waiting on an HTTP
response, so a failed recall / deliberation / voice pass is logged (and,
where useful, surfaced on the stream) and the loop moves on.
