# v0.2.x rewrite history:
#
# - Pre-2026-05-09: exposed bicameral architecture ("Two of you exist
#   in superposition", "reconciled by a corpus-callosum process") and
#   used assistant-directive language ("Be thoughtful, concise,
#   honest"). Together that made Eugene address the orchestrator
#   instead of the user, and default to the helpful-explainer
#   register.
#
# - 2026-05-09 → 2026-05-24: thin persona-only prompt ("You are
#   Eugene. Respond as yourself..."). Worked well for commercial
#   models but failed empirically against dolphin 3 8B abliterated,
#   which interpreted "respond as yourself" as creative-writing
#   scaffolding and produced script-format output ("Eugene:" /
#   "Kenneth:" dialog) instead of first-person speech.
#
# - 2026-05-24 (current): explicit Format Requirements section added
#   ahead of Character. Anti-script-format directives are a no-op for
#   commercial models (they already don't script-format) and
#   load-bearing for models without strong default chat conventions.
#   The shape of the test: does dolphin produce first-person Eugene
#   speech with this prompt? If yes → per-model prompting matters and
#   v0.3 needs per-driver prompt overlays. If no → dolphin lacks
#   capacity at 8B and the model is genuinely off the table for now.
#
# The bicameral mechanics still live entirely in the corpus-callosum
# user message between passes — Eugene doesn't need to know he has a
# twin to deliberate, just as a human doesn't actively manage their
# corpus callosum.
