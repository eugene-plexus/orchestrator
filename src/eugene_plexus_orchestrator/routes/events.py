"""POST /v1/events — the single afferent-event injection door.

Accepts one `AfferentEvent`, enqueues it for the continuous consciousness
loop, and returns `202` immediately. Fire-and-forget: this call does not
block for a reply and does not guarantee one — whether/when/how Eugene
responds is the loop's decision. Replies leave asynchronously as
`EfferentSpeechAct`s on `GET /v1/stream/consciousness`.
