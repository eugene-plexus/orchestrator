"""The bicameral loop.

For each turn:

1. Build the prompt from conversation history + the new user message.
2. Send to all configured drivers in parallel.
3. Score corpus-callosum agreement on their outputs.
4. If agreement >= threshold, terminate and emit a blended response.
5. Otherwise, append every driver's output + a re-think prompt and run
   another pass, up to `max_passes`.

v0.1 keeps this *deliberately mechanical*: there's no smart prompting
between passes, no per-driver prompt variation, no NT modulation. The
goal is to validate the cross-vendor architecture; meaningful pass-policy
work comes after we have data.

v0.1 also pins the loop at *exactly two* drivers — the agreement scoring
and blend functions are pairwise. v0.2+ generalizes to N (with a real
N-way reconciliation strategy and failover semantics).

    """Wrap the twin hemisphere's response so the model can react to it
    without misinterpreting it as user input.

    Pre-v0.2.1 history: the orchestrator originally appended both
    hemispheres' outputs to each driver's message list as
    `role=hemisphere`, intending that the hemisphere-driver would
    translate that into something the upstream LLM understood as "the
    other side's reply". But every API adapter we ship coerces
    `hemisphere` to `assistant` (the upstream APIs only know
    system/user/assistant/tool). The LLM then saw TWO of its own
    assistant turns followed by a user complaining about 'divergent
    responses' — and quite reasonably got confused, since from its
    viewpoint there was only one mind speaking.

    First fix ("prefix"): label the twin's response inline inside a
    user message. After role-coercion the LLM sees its OWN prior turn
    as `assistant` and the twin's turn as `user` with a labeled
    prefix. Works but has a known failure mode — some models latch
    onto the user-role wire-level cue and interpret the twin's
    content as something the operator said. Surfaced in the v0.2.1
    GIL trace as "you're quoting me" hallucination.

    Second fix ("parallel_thread", default): wrap the twin's output
    in <parallel_thread>...</parallel_thread> tags inside the same
    user message envelope. The tag is *defined* for the model in
    BICAMERAL_SUBSTRATE_NOTE, appended to each hemisphere's system
    prompt. The model now has explicit semantics: tagged content is
    substrate, not speech. No API portability cost — tags live at the
    content level, so CLI adapters and every HTTP backend handle them
    uniformly.
