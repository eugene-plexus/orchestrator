"""Corpus callosum: agreement signal + blend across hemisphere outputs.

The scorer is an injectable strategy because the right algorithm depends on
the runtime environment: production uses sentence-transformers cosine
similarity (semantic), tests use Jaccard word overlap (fast, no torch).

v0.1 shipped a single `jaccard_word_agreement` function — kept here as
`JaccardAgreementScorer`'s implementation. v0.2.x adds
`EmbeddingAgreementScorer` because word-overlap was triggering false
disagreements: two responses meaning the same thing in different words
were scoring 0.05-0.15 and the loop ran to `cap_reached` instead of
terminating at the actual point of agreement.
