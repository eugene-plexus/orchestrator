"""The voice pass — post-deliberation user-facing reply generation.

The bicameral deliberation loop in `loop.py` produces hemispheres
that talk to each other to reconcile. That works for internal
deliberation but produces a register problem: by pass 1+, each
hemisphere is responding to its OTHER half ("Glad we're on the same
page," "Thanks for not contradicting me"), not to the actual user.
The last hemisphere output therefore isn't appropriate to show as
Eugene's reply — it's deliberation overheard, not communication.

The voice pass is one additional LLM call after the deliberation
loop terminates. It receives:
  - Eugene's persona prompt (the same one used during deliberation)
  - The conversation history
  - The user's current message
  - An inline summary of "what you just considered" — both
    hemispheres' final deliberated content
  - A directive: "now respond to the user. Not to yourself."

The voice pass's output IS what the user sees. The hemispheres'
raw outputs stop being user-facing — they become internal
artifacts the voice pass draws from. This also implicitly solves
the `<think>`-leak risk (the voice pass regenerates clean text
regardless of how messy the deliberation got).

v0.2.x: voice pass always runs. Operator picks which driver does
it via `voiceDriver` config. v0.3+ can add NT modulation of voice
temperature, multi-voice (chorus), or skip-the-voice-pass under
certain NT states.

# v0.2.1 directive rewrite (post-v0.2.0 tag). Three changes layered
# onto the v0.2.x scratchpad-as-system-message structure:
#
#   1. Explicit "VOICE mode" framing — names the phase. The model is
#      not deliberating; the model is producing the reply. Naming the
#      phase is mechanical role assignment, which carries across
#      RLHF distributions more reliably than aspirational "be a
#      person" language.
#
#   2. Banned outputs section — names specific failure modes with
#      one-line "this is wrong because" reasons. Negative-space
#      directives ("don't do X") are more actionable than positive
#      ones ("be terse"), because the model knows what "X" looks
#      like in its own output distribution.
#
#   3. Load-bearing language for the "first three responses banned"
#      directive. The construction is borrowed from divergent-
#      ideation skill design — it specifies negative space rather
#      than positive aspiration, which is sharper than "be creative"
#      or "don't sound like an assistant."
#
# Still presumes "stranger, first turn, weird-or-normal opener"
# social context. v0.3 work: variant selection based on (a) person
# familiarity from identity, (b) conversation turn count, (c) NT
# state. For now we are validating whether sharpening the directive
# language meaningfully moves the helpful-assistant ceiling for the
# same hemispheres + same architecture — which is the test for
# whether the bicameral inner-thought-process is producing genuine
# value over a single-model baseline.
